          <h3>First-team</h3>
          <p>
            Ronaldo memorabilia at Sporting CP's museum At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager
            László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling. He subsequently became the first player to play for the
            club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team, and the first team, all within one season. A year later,
            on 7 October 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against Moreirense, and scored two goals in their
            3–0 win.</p>
          <h3 class="ui header">Manchester United</h3>

          </p>
          <h3>Development and breakthrough</h3>
          <p>
            Ronaldo became Manchester United's first-ever Portuguese player when he signed before the 2003–04 season. His transfer fee
            of £12.24 million made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history. Although he
            requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn
            by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. Wearing the number 7 became an extra source
            of motivation for Ronaldo. A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be his manager,
            Alex Ferguson, of whom he later said, "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential
            factors in my career.".</p>

          <h3>Collective and individual success</h3>
          <p>
            Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies, as United claimed their third successive Premier League title and a
            Football League Cup. He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous
            season, in four more appearances. His final ever goal for Manchester United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick
            in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford.</p>

          <h3> World record transfer and La Liga championship</h3>
          <p>
            Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time, of £80 million (€94
            million). His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out
            clause. At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record
            of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7, the
            number Ronaldo wore at Manchester United, Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt, which was presented to him by
            the former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano</p>

          <h3>Consecutive FIFA Ballon d'Or wins</h3>
          <p>
            Following the 2012–13 winter break, Ronaldo captained Real Madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring a brace
            to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4–3 victory over Real Sociedad on 6 January. He subsequently became the first non-Spanish
            player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clásico on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance.
            Three days prior, he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat-trick against Getafe. Following
            hat-tricks against Celta Vigo and Sevilla, he scored his 200th goal for Real Madrid on 8 May in a 6–2 win against
            Málaga, reaching the landmark in 197 games. He helped Madrid reach the Copa del Rey final by scoring a brace
            in El Clásico, which marked the sixth successive match at Camp Nou in which he had scored, a Real Madrid record.
            In the final, he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2–1 defeat to Atlético Madrid, but was shown a straight
            red card in the 114th minute for violent conduct. Real Madrid also failed to defend their La Liga title, finishing
            runners up to Barcelona.

          <h3>All-time Real Madrid top scorer </h3>
          <p>
            Ronaldo scored his 500th club career goal in the 2–0 victory over Club América in the semi-finals of the FIFA Club World
            Cup. He then scored a hat-trick in the 4–2 win over Japanese club Kashima Antlers in the final.Ronaldo finished
            the tournament as top scorer with four goals and was also named the best player of the tournament. He won the
            Ballon d'Or for a fourth time and the inaugural Best FIFA Men's Player, a revival of the old-style FIFA World
            Player of the Year, largely owing to his success with Portugal in winning Euro 2016

            <i>2001–06</i>
          </p>
          <h4>Youth level and early international career</h4>
          <p>A Portuguese international, Ronaldo began his youth career in 2001. Apart from the under-15 team, he also represented
            the under-17, under-20, under-21, and under-23 national sides, amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall.Ronaldo
            was subsequently booed during their 1–0 semi-final defeat to France.FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him
            for the tournament's Best Young Player award, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision.</p>
          <p>
            <i>2006–12</i>
          </p>
          <h4>Assuming the captaincy</h4>
          <p>Ronaldo scored seven goals in the qualification for Euro 2012, including two strikes against Bosnia in the play-offs,
            to send Portugal into the tournament, where they were drawn in a "group of death". After the opening 0–1 defeat
            to Germany, he also failed to score in the 3–2 win against Denmark, missing two clear one-on-one chances.He redeemed
            himself in the last group match against the Netherlands, where he scored twice to secure a 2–1 victory, and the
            quarter-finals against the Czech Republic, scoring a header to give his team a 1–0 win. He was named man of the
            match against both opponents. After the semi-finals against Spain ended scoreless, with Ronaldo having sent three
            shots over the bar, Portugal were eliminated in the penalty shootout. Ronaldo did not take a penalty as he had
            been slated to take the unused fifth, a decision that drew criticism. As the joint top scorer with three goals,
            alongside five other players, he was again included in the team of the tournament.</p>
          <p>
            <i>2012–16</i>
          </p>
          <h4>All-time Portugal top scorer and European champion</h4>
          <p>Ronaldo became the first player to score in four European Championships, having made a record 17 appearances in
            the tournament.Though placed third in their group behind Hungary and Iceland, his team qualified for the knockout
            round as a result of the competition's newly expanded format.</p>
          <p>
            <i>2016–present</i>
          </p>
          <h4>Post-European Championship victory</h4>
          <p>Ronaldo's hat-trick took his World Cup qualifying goals total to 29, making him the highest scorer in European
            World Cup qualifiers, ahead of Andriy Shevchenko, and the highest goalscorer in World Cup qualifying and finals
            matches combined, with 32 goals, ahead of Miroslav Klose.</p>
